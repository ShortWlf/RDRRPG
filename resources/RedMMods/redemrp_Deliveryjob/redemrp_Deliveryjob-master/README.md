# redemrp_Deliveryjob

BUILT USING AMAKUU'S FARMER JOB SCRIPT

Add redemrp_Deliveryjob to your [redemrp] folder

Add ensure redemrp_Deliveryjob to your server.cfg


*What the job is*

Add's starting points to Annesburg, Valentine, Blackwater and MacFarlands Ranch (Cowboy hat icon)

After pressing E to start the job, a yellow marker blip will be added to your map. Once you reach the destination,
you will be asked to press F to make the delivery, then you get paid. 

Payouts are cash, gold and xp.
Each starting point has it's own finishing point, everthing from the points to payouts can be changed in the config.lua

*Future Plans*

To make the gold payout a flip of a coin type of deal, maybe you get gold, maybe you don't.

Add more deliverys for each town.

Credit to amakuu for the payout functions and the structure of the client side lua, as I used redemrp_farmerjob as starting point.
