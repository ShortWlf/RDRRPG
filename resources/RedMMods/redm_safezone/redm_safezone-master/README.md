# RedM_Safezone

The code to create safe zone for player. All player are unable to shoot/use their weapon in safezone.

Add ensure redm_safezone to server.cfg

Modified config file to add your own safezone location.

This resource is have an original from FiveM repository : https://github.com/ALongPantsMan/SafeZonev2 by ALongPantsMan, I made this code by changing many Native Code for redM project, that's why I decided to create separate repo.
