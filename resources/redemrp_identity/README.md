# redemrp_identity
 a Multicharacter and Identity system for RedEM:RP Framework

## 1. Installation
- Be sure you have RedEM and RedEM:RP Installed
if not --> [RedEM](https://github.com/kanersps/redem) --> [RedEM:RP](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redem_roleplay)
- Clone redem_identity into [redemrp] folder
- add ```ensure redemrp_identity``` after ```ensure redem_roleplay```

## 2. Usage
- Use 'Config.CameraLocation' to set the location of the camera
- Use 'Config.UsingRespawn' to opt in or out of using [RedEM-RP Respawn](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redemrp_respawn) *NOTE : You must either install RedEM-RP Respawn OR set this to false, otherwise, after selecting/creating a character, your camera won't move.*
- Use 'Config.SpawnPoint' if 'Config.UsingRespawn' is set to false to set the location of where players will spawn.
