# redemrp_respawn
 Respawning and Spawn Place Selection System for RedEM:RP Framework

## 1. Installation
- Be sure you have RedEM and RedEM:RP Installed
if not -> [RedEM](https://github.com/kanersps/redem) --> [RedEM:RP](https://github.com/RedEM-RP/redem_roleplay)
- Clone redemrp_respawn into [redemrp] folder
- add ```ensure redemrp_respawn``` after ```ensure redem_roleplay```
- Import the ```Coords``` Sql.
- The default in this version is to use the savecoords, 1 spawn and save coords.
- To do: Clean up the code and changing the save fuction so it works on server side instead of a single save for each client.
- I know the code is kinda messy right now and i need to clean it but everything works right now.

## 2. Usage
- Any config you can set in config.lua file
